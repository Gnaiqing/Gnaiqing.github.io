I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I am advised by [Prof. Nick Koudas](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~koudas/). My research interests lie in the intersection of **machine learning, data science and data systems**. My recent work focus on **efficient data annotation for machine learning** with techniques like LLM annotation, weak supervision and active learning. 
I am also interested in leveraging LLM agents for efficient data annotation tasks. You can find a list of my publications [here](/publications/).

**I am on the job market now!** Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any opportunities or are interested in collaboration.
