**Combining weak supervision with active learning for accurate and efficient data annotation.**

Modern machine learning models require large labelled datasets
to achieve good performance, but manually labelling large datasets
is expensive and time-consuming. The data programming paradigm enables users to label large datasets efficiently but produces
noisy labels, which deteriorates the downstream modelâ€™s performance. The active learning paradigm, on the other hand, can
acquire accurate labels but only for a small fraction of instances.
In this paper, we propose ActiveDP, an interactive framework
bridging active learning and data programming together to generate labels with both high accuracy and coverage, combining the
strengths of both paradigms. Experiments show that ActiveDP
outperforms previous weak supervision and active learning approaches and consistently performs well under different labelling
budgets.
